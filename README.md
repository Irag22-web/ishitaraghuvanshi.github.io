## Deploy (GitHub Pages)
1. Create a GitHub repo (public)  
2. Upload everything from this folder to the repo root  
3. Repo → Settings → Pages  
4. Source: Deploy from a branch  
5. Branch: main / folder: /(root) → Save  
6. Open the URL GitHub shows you (takes ~1–3 minutes the first time)

## Notes
- This is a single `index.html` so CSS/JS won’t break due to missing paths.
- Lily pads + flowers are in `assets/` and hover-wobble on the page.
